Step 1: 
    - Create a block ( with low difficulty) OK
    - Send it to a single DPU OK
    - Retrieve the Nonce OK 
    - Benchmarking OK , Very consistent 443.8 .
    - Use tasklets OK
    - Benchmark tasklets TODO
    - Terminate tasklets when we got a golden nonce TODO
BUG : However, whatever your choice is, you have to carefully manage counter overflows, since the hardware counter is 36-bit wide. Also, 
remember that the counter precision is 16 cycles (or instructions). MANAGE COUNTER OVERFLOWS
//TODO create mining context , manage communication between host and dpu using the structure

Step 2: 
    -Use many DPUS
    -Retrieve the right result
    -Finish other DPUs
    -Benchmarking
Step 3:
Rewrite cpu-miner : hardest step in theory
