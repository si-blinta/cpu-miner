Step 1:
On upmem pim :
    - Create a block ( with low difficulty)
    - Send it to a single DPU
    - Retrieve the Nonce
    - Benchmarking
Step 2:
On normal architecture:
    -Implement multithreading

Step 3:
On upmem pim :
    -Use many DPUS
    -Retrieve the right result
    -Finish other DPUs
    -Benchmarking

Step 4:
On upmem pim :
    -Use tasklets
    -Benchmarking
Step 5:
Rewrite cpu-miner : hardest step in theory
